# SecureShare
This repo consists of my Cryptography course project which involves safe transfer of files between users using cryptographic encryptions.

## Project Overview
SecureShare is designed to facilitate secure communication between users by employing various cryptographic techniques. The primary goal is to ensure that messages are encrypted before transmission and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely.
- **File Encryption**: All files are encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- **Secure Key Exchange**: Utilizes RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for secure key exchange between users.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for sending and receiving messages.

## Code Flow
1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - Users can create an account, which securely stores their credentials.
   - Upon login, the system verifies the user's identity.

2. **File Sending**:
   - When a user sends a file, the application encrypts the file using the recipient's public key.
   - The encrypted file is then sent over the network.

3. **File Receiving**:
   - The recipient receives the encrypted file and uses their private key to decrypt it.
   - The decrypted file is made available for download in the user interface.

4. **Key Management**:
   - The application manages public and private keys for each user, ensuring that keys are stored securely.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohithvarma444/SecureShare.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SecureShare
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, execute:
```bash
node app.py
```
## .env
```bash
JWT_SECRET=<secret_key>
MONGO_URI=<mongoDb-connection-url>

```
